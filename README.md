**ToDoApp**

#Final Project: Mobile Cordova and Ionic 5 points

#Directions

In this final project, you will build a todo list app using Cordova and Ionic.
Follow the directions below and if you have any questions reach out to your
instructor/mentor.

- Build an Ionic app that uses AngularJS or angular2 to implement a simple
todo list app. 

1. It should allow you to add todo items 
2. and mark item status as pending , complete , or overdue . 
3. It should allow you to update and 
4. delete todo items. 
5. It should allow you to view a list of all existing todo items, 
6. as well as just those todo items that are currently pending , 
7. as well as just those items that are currently overdue . 
8. Each todo item has a unique id field, 
9. as well as fields for the todo item named name and status .
10. The app should remember the todo item state over the ling term. To do
that, you can store app state data in an embedded SQLite database, or a
custom online web service that you host on a Azure or AWS, or just read
and write the data to internal 􀃒le storage on the local device. For more
information on Android storage options, see: Storage Options
(https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html).
11. Of course, you can use google search and stackover􀃓ow.com, as well as
the many available tutorials and videos on the web. You can also use any
GitHub repos that you can 􀃒nd that might help you develop your own
solution. If you 􀃒nd a GitHub project or a tutorial example that is very
close to meeting these assignment requirements, do try to customize it
in some interesting and signi􀃒cant ways, because you will want a
distinctive code example of your own, on your GitHub account, to show
potential employers what you can do. However, you are permitted to
copy and use any public domain code in your solution that you 􀃒nd in
any coding resources that might be helpful. Just be careful to check any
copyright notices that may exist within existing code to avoid
copyrighted infringement.
12. Provide the link to your project solution, on GitHub, to your instructor for
veri􀃒cation.
